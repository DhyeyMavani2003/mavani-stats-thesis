abstract="Visualization is an essential component of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) in discovering and understanding dependence structure of the data for formal statistical modeling and inference. In this paper, we propose a graphical approach designed to explore and visualize the regression dependence structure in a multi-way contingency table with an ordinal dependent variable and a set of independent categorical (ordinal or nominal) variables. The proposed method is based on copula regressions developed for ordinal variables which enable prediction of the category of the ordinal dependent variable for any given combination of categories of independent variables in a model-free manner. We then employ resampling techniques to facilitate visualizing the uncertainty involved in the prediction and significance of the discovered regression associations. Since estimation of copula regression and its prediction do not require any parametric assumption on the dependence structure between an ordinal dependent variable and a set of independent categorical variables, one can use the proposed method as a non-model-based visualization tool for the EDA of multidimensional contingency tables with an ordinal dependent variable.",

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new data-driven method to explore complex regression dependence structures in a multi-dimensional contingency table with an ordinal response variable and categorical (ordinal or nominal) explanatory variables. The proposed method is based on a sequential decomposition of the overall regression dependence for the data quantified by the checkerboard copula regression association measure (Wei and Kim, 2021) in an informative and interpretable fashion. It can measure the marginal and conditional contributions of any subset of all available explanatory variables to the overall regression association in a hierarchical manner taking into account the order of the explanatory variables. Thus, the proposed method enables a holistic description of various aspects of regression association in a multivariate contingency table, including marginal and conditional associations between an ordinal response variable and a subset of explanatory variables of interest. We investigate theoretical properties of the proposed decomposition method, and we further illustrate its performance through simulation and two real data examples, one from a randomized controlled trial and the other from a longitudinal epidemiological study.}

 abstract = {A general approach to regression modelling for ordered categorical response variables, y, is given, which is equally applicable to ordered and unordered y. The regressor variables xT = (x1,...,xp) may be continuous or categorical. The method is based on the logistic family which contains a hierarchy of regression models, ranging from ordered to unordered models. Ordered properties of the former, the stereotype model, are established. The choice between models is made empirically on the basis of model fit. This is particularly important for assessed, ordered categorical response variables, where it is not obvious a priori whether or not the ordering is relevant to the regression relationship. Model simplification is investigated in terms of whether or not the response categories are distinguishable with respect to x. The models are fitted iteratively using the method of maximum likelihood. Examples are given.},
