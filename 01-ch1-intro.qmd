# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a concept first articulated by John Tukey in 1977 [@Tukey], forms an indispensable foundation for statistical analyses and modern data science workflows. Tukey underscored the significance of letting data guide hypothesis generation, rather than relying exclusively on pre-defined models or confirmatory statistical tests. According to Tukey, exploring data should precede formal modeling efforts, as it reveals patterns, structures, outliers, and underlying assumptions that would otherwise remain hidden or overlooked (@Tukey; @Buja2009; @Gelman2021). The classic example of Anscombe’s quartet [@Anscombe1973] vividly illustrates how datasets with identical summary statistics—means, variances, and correlation coefficients—can exhibit dramatically different relationships once explored visually, reinforcing the necessity of visual exploration in the preliminary stages of data analysis.

In practical terms, EDA employs a variety of visualization techniques and statistical summaries designed to enhance intuitive understanding and detect anomalies, thereby ensuring the validity and robustness of subsequent analyses. (@Tufte1983; @Donoho2017) Modern analytical frameworks, such as the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) [@Shearer2000], explicitly incorporate EDA to inform data preprocessing, feature selection, and model construction. Particularly in high-dimensional or complex datasets, effective EDA is crucial for identifying relevant variables, understanding multivariate interactions, and preventing misleading conclusions.

As the dimensionality and complexity of datasets increase, traditional EDA methods face significant challenges, particularly in effectively capturing complex dependence structures within multivariate categorical data, which is typically presented as multi-dimensional contingency table. Not only, there have been efforts to extend continuous data visualization methods to the discrete case, but also many graphical methods were developed specifically for categorical data. [@Liao2024]

While visualization remains a powerful tool, statistical methodologies capable of systematically modeling and quantifying dependence become increasingly necessary as complements. Copula theory provides a promising approach for addressing these complexities. A copula is a mathematical function that combines marginal distributions of individual variables into a comprehensive joint distribution, enabling distinct and flexible modeling of dependence structures independently from marginal behaviors (@sklar1959fonctions; @nelsen; @Joe2014). Copulas have found widespread application across diverse fields, notably finance, engineering, and environmental studies, particularly due to their ability to capture intricate and non-linear dependence patterns beyond traditional correlation measures.

Despite the advantages copulas offer in modeling continuous data, their application to discrete or categorical variables presents unique challenges. For discrete data, the copula representation is generally not unique, complicating standard analytical procedures. Addressing these issues, the checkerboard copula has been proposed as a pragmatic and effective method for modeling discrete dependencies. This technique assigns uniform probabilities within discrete segments or 'blocks,' preserving the dependency structure intrinsic to categorical data while minimizing additional assumptions [@weikim]. The checkerboard copula thus facilitates capturing complex dependencies that are otherwise challenging to quantify using conventional copula approaches.

One key aspect of statistical modeling that has consistently intrigued researchers across various disciplines—including social sciences, healthcare, economics, and behavioral research—is regression dependence. [@weikim] Specifically, regression dependence aims to quantify and interpret relationships where one variable, designated as the response, depends on a set of explanatory variables. Ordinal response variables present unique analytical challenges, necessitating methods specifically tailored to their inherent ordered structure.

Traditionally, assessing regression dependence in ordinal categorical data has relied primarily on parametric, model-based methods. Popular approaches include cumulative logit (proportional odds) models, cumulative link models with alternative links (probit, log-log, complementary log-log), adjacent-categories logit models, continuation ratio logit models, stereotype models, latent variable and association models, canonical correlation analyses, and correspondence analysis models [@weikim]. While these approaches offer robust frameworks for explanatory or predictive modeling, they impose specific structural assumptions about relationships within the data, potentially limiting their exploratory power.

Alternatively, non-model-based approaches have been developed to provide flexible assessments of association without predefined functional forms. Commonly utilized methods include generalized Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel procedures, ordinal odds ratios, Kendall's tau and its variants, Goodman and Kruskal's gamma, Spearman’s rank correlation, Somers' D, and Kendall’s partial tau [@weikim]. Despite their widespread use, these traditional methods suffer from significant limitations. They primarily address pairwise associations, often treat variables symmetrically without distinguishing clearly between explanatory and response roles, and inadequately leverage the ordinal information inherent within categorical data. Specifically, it is not straightforward to use non-model-based methods when our objective is to understand regression dependence in multivariate ordinal data with an ordinal response variable. [@weikim]

To address these limitations, recent methodological innovations by @weikim have introduced the Checkerboard Copula Regression Association Measure (CCRAM) and its scaled counterpart, Scaled CCRAM (SCCRAM). The foundational tool of this method is the checkerboard (multilinear extension) copula [@genest2014; @schweizer1974], constructed through multilinear interpolation of discrete marginal distributions. Checkerboard copulas uniquely capture and represent the dependence structure among discrete ordinal variables, offering a robust basis for exploring multivariate contingency tables [@denuit2005; @neslehova2007].

CCRAM is a non-parametric, model-free measure explicitly designed to quantify regression-type dependencies involving an ordinal response and multiple categorical explanatory variables. By leveraging checkerboard copula scores—which incorporate the informative ordinal rankings of variables—CCRAM provides a comprehensive, robust measure analogous to the R-squared statistic commonly used in linear regression but tailored specifically for categorical contexts. It flexibly accommodates high-dimensional data, providing interpretable summaries of dependencies within complex contingency tables. [@weikim]

The introduction of SCCRAM further enhances interpretability by scaling CCRAM values onto a standardized 0–1 interval. This scaling facilitates straightforward, intuitive comparisons of association strengths across diverse research contexts and datasets. Additionally, CCRAM and SCCRAM enable detailed decomposition of multivariate dependencies, allowing researchers to isolate and analyze contributions from individual variables or subsets of predictors—an advantage notably lacking in traditional non-model-based measures [@JMA2023].

This thesis is based upon these recent methodological innovations highlighted in @weikim and @Liao2024, aims to better understand these novel methods, and for the first time ever, introduce a Python package encapsulating the end-to-end EDA workflow that allow researchers to run their experiments correctly, and efficiently without worrying about implementational details of the methods all the time. In this work, we limit our focus to development of EDA workflow for multivariate-categorical data with an ordinal response variable and a set of independent categorical (ordinal or nominal) variables in a multi-way contingency table.

The remainder of the thesis is structured as follows. Chapter 2 provides an extensive review of copula theory and key association measures, beginning with an exploration of the fundamental concepts of dependence and copula functions, emphasizing continuous data contexts. It includes a discussion of Sklar’s theorem and the invariance principle, elaborates on copula modeling applicable to both continuous and discrete data, and covers essential copula-based association measures such as Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho, laying the theoretical foundation necessary for subsequent developments. Chapter 3 introduces Checkerboard Copula Regression (CCR), addressing the unique challenges posed by multivariate categorical data. It presents the theoretical formulation of checkerboard copulas, defines the checkerboard copula score, and illustrates the CCR methodology, its predictive capabilities, visualization techniques, and the novel Checkerboard Copula Regression Association Measure (CCRAM). Chapter 4 focuses on the practical implementation and testing of CCR within CCRVAM, the novel software package that we developed, detailing the data requirements, software architecture, computational strategies, visualization tools, and rigorous validation processes. Chapter 5 provides a comprehensive empirical application of the proposed methods to real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of CCR in uncovering hidden dependence structures and improving analytical insights. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes the key contributions, outlines the significance of integrating exploratory data analysis, copula theory, and novel association metrics, acknowledges current limitations, and suggests promising directions for future research, including methodological extensions and advanced visualization approaches.
