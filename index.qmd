# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Understanding regression dependencies among discrete variables—particularly when dealing with ordinal responses—remains a challenging yet vital task for uncovering the underlying structure in complex datasets. Traditional exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods and continuous copula models offer valuable insights for continuous data, but they often fall short when applied directly to categorical data, leading to issues with interpretability and generalizability. This thesis first revisits these traditional approaches, critically examining their limitations in the context of discrete data analysis. Building on this foundation, we explore @weikim and @Liao2024's model‐free dependence measure based on the checkerboard copula to robustly identify and quantify regression relationships in multidimensional contingency ta bles containing both ordinal and nominal variables. The work then introduces the development of novel, scalable, modularized implementations—primarily in Python, using complementary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib to enhance efficiency for large-scale analyses. Through extensive experimentation and real-world case studies, the proposed framework and accompanying software package, `ccrvam`, are shown to provide researchers with a powerful and flexible resource for exploratory modeling, paving the way for deeper insights into regression dependence structures in categorical datasets.

I want to thank everyone who made my experience unforgettable during my thesis journey. Firstly, I want to convey my gratitude to Professor Shu-Min Liao for advising me throughout my time at Amherst College and believing in me to take on the challenge of developing a statistical software component encompassing her most recent research work. From my first research experience on campus building R-Blocks to introducing me to her research collaborator (Professor Daeyoung Kim), Prof. Liao played a pivotal role in my development. Additionally, I am indebted to Prof. Kim for his continuous encouragement and feedback throughout this past year.

I am also incredibly grateful to my college and statistics major advisor, Professor Nicholas Horton, for always advocating for me and supporting me throughout the Amherst College experience. I also thank Prof. Jun Ishii, Prof. Amy Wagaman, Prof. Katharine Correia, and Prof. Pamela Matheson for teaching me Advanced Econometrics, Advanced Data Analysis, Missing Data Analysis, and Intermediate Statistics, which helped me gain a clear and solid understanding of the foundational tools.

Finally, I would like to express gratitude towards my family for their constant belief in my abilities. Special thanks to my mom, dad, sister, grandfather, and grandmother for making me capable of the opportunity to study abroad. Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends, and peers on campus, who took courses, worked, and played sports with me. This academic, personal, and professional growth journey would not be possible without their support.
