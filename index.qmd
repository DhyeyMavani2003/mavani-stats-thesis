# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Understanding regression dependencies among discrete variables in categorical data—especially with ordinal responses—is a significant challenge in fields like finance, where the natural order of variables can unlock deeper insights into underlying distributions and data generating processes (DGPs). While numerous model-based methods have been developed to examine these structures, there is a notable lack of flexible, model-free approaches. To address this gap, a novel model-free measure based on the checkerboard copula, was introduced by @weikim to identify and quantify regression dependence in multivariate categorical data involving both ordinal and nominal variables. Building upon this foundation, my thesis focuses on developing scalable and modularized implementations of discrete checkerboard copula modeling in R and Python, utilizing parallel computing to enhance efficiency and accessibility for large-scale data analysis. Initial experimentation and deployment confirm the effectiveness of these tools, providing researchers with a powerful resource for exploratory modeling and a deeper investigation into regression dependence structures within complex categorical datasets.

I want to thank everyone who made my experience unforgettable during my thesis journey. Firstly, I want to convey my gratitude to Professor Shu-Min Liao for advising me throughout my time at Amherst College and believing in me to take on the challenge of developing a statistical software component encompassing her most recent research work. From my first research experience on campus building R-Blocks to introducing me to her research collaborator (Professor Daeyoung Kim), Prof. Liao played a pivotal role in my development. Additionally, I am indebted to Dr. Kim for his continuous encouragement and feedback while developing the software this past year.

I am also incredibly grateful to my college advisor and statistics major advisor, Professor Nicholas Horton, for always advocating for me and supporting me throughout the Amherst College experience. I also thank Professor Jun Ishii for teaching me Advanced Econometrics and Professor Amy Wagaman for teaching me Advanced Data Analysis, which helped me gain a clear and solid understanding of the foundational tools I could build on in this work.

Finally, I would like to express gratitude towards my family for their constant belief in my abilities. Special thanks to my mom, dad, sister, grandfather, and grandmother for making me capable of the opportunity to study abroad. Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends, peers, and colleagues on campus, who took courses, worked, and played sports with me. This academic, personal, and professional growth journey would not be possible without their support.
