# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Understanding regression dependencies among discrete variables—especially in the presence of ordinal responses—poses a persistent challenge in exploratory data analysis (EDA). While classical EDA techniques and continuous copula models have proven effective for continuous data, they often fail to capture the structure and interpretability required for categorical datasets. This thesis begins by critically evaluating these traditional approaches and highlighting their limitations in discrete settings. Motivated by these gaps, we explore the model-free dependence measures proposed by @weikim and further advanced by @Liao2024, which leverages the checkerboard copula framework to robustly characterize regression relationships in multidimensional contingency tables with both ordinal and nominal variables.

To operationalize this method, we present a novel, modular, and scalable Python package, `ccrvam`, designed to support efficient large-scale analysis. The package integrates with established scientific libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib, while incorporating Pytest and Sphinx for testing and maintainability. Through extensive simulations and real-world case studies, we demonstrate that `ccrvam` offers a powerful and flexible toolset for uncovering complex dependence structures in categorical data. Our contributions provide both a theoretical exposition and a novel practical resource for researchers engaged in data-driven exploration of discrete regression phenomena.

I am incredibly thankful to everyone who made this thesis journey one I will never forget.

First, I owe so much to Professor Shu-Min Liao. From my first research experience at Amherst—developing R-Blocks—to taking on the challenge of building `ccrvam` based on her most recent work, she trusted me, guided me, and pushed me to grow. She also introduced me to Professor Daeyoung Kim, whose thoughtful feedback and encouragement over the past year helped shape this project. I am grateful to both of them for believing in me and for their time and energy in my development.

I also want to thank Professor Nicholas Horton, my statistics advisor, who has supported me throughout my time at Amherst. His mentorship, encouragement, and always-clear advice have meant a great deal to me. I am also thankful to Professors Amy Wagaman, Jun Ishii, Matteo Riondato, Katharine Correia, Pamela Matheson, and Brittney Bailey. Their classes—Advanced Data Analysis, Advanced Econometrics, Data Mining, Missing Data Analysis, Intermediate Statistics, and Data Science respectively—gave me the foundation to take on this work. Special thanks to Professor Bailey for creating the `.qmd` thesis template and helping with the formatting and Python integration—her help made this process smoother.

Lastly, to my family: Mom, Dad, my sister, grandparents—thank you for everything. Your belief in me and your sacrifices made this possible. And to my friends and peers at Amherst—thank you for the discussions, competitions, club events, pickup games, and all the little moments in between.
