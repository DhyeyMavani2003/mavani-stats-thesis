# Applications of Parallel Computing {#sec-simple}

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

# Set default ggplot theme for document
theme_set(theme_classic())
# If using kableExtra tables, print blank cells instead of `NA`
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")

# Load data
load("data/temp_wnba.RData")
```

Start with motivation, connect, and dive into details + examples of parallel computing along with use-cases.
