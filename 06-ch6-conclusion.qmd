# Conclusion and Future Work {#sec-concl}

Exploratory Data Analysis of multivariate categorical data with ordinal responses presents unique challenges that traditional statistical methodologies often struggle to address effectively. This thesis has presented a comprehensive framework synthesizing copula theory, regression dependence concepts, and modern computational approaches to overcome these limitations. By starting with an introduction to dependence, exploring continuous copula, bridging to discrete cases, building upon the methodological innovations proposed by @weikim, and extending their practical implementation, we have developed a robust analytical workflow encapsulated in a novel Python package, providing researchers with accessible tools for rigorous analysis of complex categorical data structures. The primary contribution of this work lies in bridging the theoretical foundations of copula theory with practical exploratory data analysis, resulting in a unified framework tailored explicitly for categorical data analysis. The `ccrvam` Python package represents the first end-to-end implementation of Checkerboard Copula Regression methods, enabling researchers to apply these sophisticated techniques without requiring extensive knowledge of the underlying mathematical complexities. Furthermore, rigorous testing on both simulated and real-world datasets has demonstrated the robustness and utility of the CCR approach and (S)CCRAM measures for quantifying regression dependence in multivariate categorical data.

Unlike traditional association measures that often treat variables symmetrically, the CCR approach explicitly accommodates regression dependence, preserving the crucial distinction between response and explanatory variables. This orientation toward regression dependence makes the methods particularly valuable in fields such as healthcare, social sciences, and economics, where understanding causal and predictive relationships is paramount. The model-free nature of CCR and (S)CCRAM offers significant advantages over parametric approaches by avoiding potentially restrictive assumptions about functional forms, allowing researchers to explore dependencies in data without imposing predetermined structures. This flexibility reveals patterns that conventional modeling approaches might miss. Developing novel visualization methods enhances the interpretability of dependence structures in categorical data, going beyond traditional contingency table representations to provide intuitive visual insights into complex multivariate relationships.

Despite these advances, several limitations warrant acknowledgment in the current implementation. As the dimensionality of the contingency table increases, the computational requirements for CCR analysis grow substantially, potentially challenging the analysis of extremely high-dimensional datasets despite our implemented optimizations. While (S)CCRAM provides a quantitative measure of association strength, interpreting the practical significance of specific values remains more art than science, lacking the direct translation to marginal effects that traditional regression coefficients offer. As with many non-parametric methods, CCR approaches require adequate sample sizes to estimate dependence structures reliably, particularly for complex multivariate scenarios. The current implementation also requires complete data in contingency tables, with no built-in mechanisms for addressing missing values beyond the preprocessing steps.

Integrating bootstrap resampling and permutation testing within our framework provides much-needed statistical inference capabilities previously unavailable for model-free approaches to categorical data analysis. These techniques enable researchers to quantify uncertainty in predictions and association measures, offering confidence intervals and formal hypothesis tests that enhance the rigor of categorical data analysis. The `ccrvam` package thus democratizes access to advanced statistical methods by abstracting away complex mathematical details while preserving methodological rigor, enabling researchers across disciplines to incorporate these techniques into their analytical workflows without specialized statistical expertise.

This work opens several promising avenues for future research and methodological development. One crucial direction involves formalizing conditional (S)CCRAM, as theorized in @JMA2023, which would extend the utility of these dependence measures by enabling the quantification of partial associations while controlling for confounding variables. Another key extension lies in broadening the framework to support joint analysis of continuous and categorical variables, enhancing its applicability across a broader range of empirical settings. Similarly, adapting CCR-based techniques for longitudinal or time series categorical data would allow for studying temporal dependencies in ordinal outcomes.

From a computational standpoint, advancing algorithmic efficiency remains a critical priority, particularly for high-dimensional scenarios. Future work could explore sparse matrix representations, approximate inference, or other memory-efficient strategies. While this thesis introduces basic parallelization support, further integration with "embarrassingly parallel frameworks" and GPU-accelerated computation on the developer side (without user overhead) would significantly improve scalabilityâ€”especially for the bootstrap and permutation procedures of (S)CCRAM, which are often the computationally intensive components of the analysis pipeline.

Further advances in visualization and explainability present another promising direction, with the potential for developing interactive visualization components that allow researchers to explore dependence structures dynamically. Research into decomposing (S)CCRAM values into interpretable components could enhance the explanatory power of the measure. Domain-specific implementations tailored for healthcare, finance, or social sciences could enhance adoption by incorporating field-specific knowledge and constraints while developing bridges to common statistical environments to facilitate incorporation into established research pipelines.

Exploring regression dependence in multivariate categorical data remains a rich and challenging area of statistical research. As data collection continues to proliferate across fields, the need for sophisticated yet accessible methods for categorical data analysis will only increase. This thesis has contributed to advancing this field by reviewing theoretical insights and engineering novel practical tools through the lens of checkerboard copulas and associated regression methods. We aim to enhance researchers' ability to extract meaningful insights from categorical data across diverse domains by enabling model-free exploration of complex dependence structures. The framework presented in this thesis represents one step toward addressing this need. However, much work remains to realize the potential of copula-based approaches for exploratory data analysis of categorical information. We hope that both the methodological advances reviewed and the software tools presented here will serve as valuable resources for researchers and inspire continued innovation.
